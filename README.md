# Linear MATLAB Solver

A very simple MATLAB script that solves basic linear equations (e.g. `7x + 8 = 9 + 3x`).  
This tool only solves for single-variable equations with one unknown (`x`).

## Features
- Solves linear equations for `x`.
- Handles basic mathmatics with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `=`.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juancruz85/linear-matlab-solver.git
